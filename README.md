![SaaSAWS](images/SaaS-Factory.png "SaaS Factory")

---------------------
##### You are invited to join the AWS SaaS Factory team at the SaaS on AWS Bootcamp, which will provide a guided, interactive experience of building software-as-a-service (SaaS) on AWS. The bootcamp will walk attendees through core concepts of building SaaS on AWS, including how to provision, configure, and refine elements of a SaaS application.
     
##### Because SaaS presents developers with a unique blend of challenges: multi-tenancy, onboarding, security, data partitioning, tenant isolation, and identity, the best way to understand architectural principles of SaaS is to dig into working examples of designing, building, and optimizing SaaS. In this bootcamp, weâ€™ll expose you to the core concepts of SaaS architecture then dive into a reference SaaS architecture where you can see the moving parts of a SaaS solution in action. The goal is to provide a series of activities that allow attendees to interact with a functional solution, introducing code and configuration that realizes and extends the capabilities of this SaaS environment. Through this combination of lecture and hands on exercises, attendees will gain greater insight into SaaS on AWS best practices, through the lens of a working reference solution.

### Who should attend?

##### Application developers and architects that are looking to get into the details of implementing a SaaS solution on AWS are encouraged to attend. The content of the bootcamp is geared toward those newer to SaaS, however, even if you have a background in SaaS, this experience could still expose you to specifics of delivering SaaS on AWS.

### Why should you attend? 

##### Our SaaS experts have many years of experience building, migrating, and managing SaaS products on AWS. This is a great opportunity to meet the team, ask them questions, and jumpstart your SaaS journey, through an interactive, guided experience with SaaS on AWS.
